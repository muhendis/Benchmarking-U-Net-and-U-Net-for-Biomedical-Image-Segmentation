# Benchmarking U-Net and U-Net++ for Biomedical Image Segmentation

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the evaluation and comparison of the U-Net and U-Net++ architectures in the context of biomedical image segmentation. 

## Repository Structure
- `splitted-images/`: Contains images that have been preprocessed and split for training and testing.
- `weights/`: Holds the pre-trained weights for U-Net and U-Net++ models.
- `u_net_original.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation and training of the U-Net model.
- `u_net++_original.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation and training of the U-Net++ model.

## Installation
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab, which provides a free, cloud-based service with all the necessary dependencies pre-installed. You don't need to set up your environment locally. However, if you wish to run it locally, ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the required libraries installed.

### Using Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the notebooks and dataset provided in this repository.
3. Google Colab provides a Python environment with the necessary libraries already installed.
